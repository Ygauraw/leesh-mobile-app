This is the leesh mobile app.

It uses the struct project with joli.js as an ORM model and Stately.js for a controller.

Currently in alpha development for "completion" in May 2013.

The core function of the app is to notify users when one group device is too far from the others in the group.

Extended features in development allow other members of the group to confirm an abduction 
within minutes of it occurring, law enforcement to be notified by others in the group with 
pertinent information from the device on the victim's person. I am loosely working with 
Federal law enforcement to decide upon what device tracking and environmental information 
would be pertinent to provide, what scenarios and when to provide it, and to what law 
enforcement resources should receive it.

Technology used is Javascript on a Titanium Mobile development stack for both Android and 
iOS with local and cloud tracked geofencing. Geomath provided by local calculation confirmed 
by the Google Maps Tracks API.
